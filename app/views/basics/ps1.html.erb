    <td>The objective was to scrape the headlines, links and images from Google news. It was done using nokogiri. In nokogiri,we can scrape particular html elements using css Selectors
    For example: doc.css('h2.OJMBqe') will point towards an h2 element of that name. The process was to find elements sharing the same names and then scraping them to collect them in an array and
      then render in an html document.
